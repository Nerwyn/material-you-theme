# Material You Theme - A Fully Featured Implementation of Material Design 3 for Home Assistant

A theme for Home Assistant influenced by Google apps and Material Design 3 by Google on Android.

In addition to the standard Home Assistant theme YAML file, this repository also includes a JavaScript module which generates color themes based on user defined inputs and injects custom styles into many Home Assistant custom components to follow the [Material Design 3 specifications](https://m3.material.io/). The custom style injection only occurs when an element is first added to a page, and should have little to no performance impact.

Everything in Home Assistant has been updated to use colors generated using [Material Color Utilities](https://github.com/material-foundation/material-color-utilities) following the [Material Design 3 guidelines](https://m3.material.io/). It supports custom user colors for virtually all of Home Assistant. If no user input is provided for base color, scheme name, or contrast level, the themes defaults to base color `#4C5C92` (a shade of blue), scheme name `Tonal Spot`, and contrast level `0`.

This theme implements Material Design 3 redesigns of elements when possible using a mix of Home Assistant theme variables and CSS styles applied to Home Assistant custom element constructor lifecycle methods.

This theme also includes "Transparent Card" versions with transparent card backgrounds. It also includes separate light and dark versions of all themes for niche use cases. These variations are combined into several different versions of the theme.

</p>

## Basic Theme Installation

1. Navigate to HACS (install from [here](https://hacs.xyz/) if you do not have it yet).
2. Navigate to `Frontend`.
3. Click `+ EXPLORE & DOWNLOAD REPOSITORIES` and search for `Material You Theme`.
4. Open this repository in HACS and click `DOWNLOAD`.
5. Refresh your browser or close and open your app.
6. Navigate to your Profile, and select `Material You` or one of its variants.

**If you set the theme at the view level, it will not style the anything outside of the view. The view tabs and sidebar are outside of the view. You MUST set the theme in [profile settings](http://homeassistant.local:8123/profile/general) under browser settings for colors and component design upgrades to work.**

## (Optional) Figtree Font Installation

I recommend using [`Figtree`](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Figtree) font with this theme, as it is very similar to the proprietary Google Sans font found in may Google apps but is free to use. If not installed the theme will use `Roboto`, which is still used by many Material You apps.

1. Navigate to a dashboard and then click `ðŸ–‰ Edit dashboard` > `â‹® Open dashboard menu` > `Manage resources`.
2. Click `+ Add Resource`.
3. In the `URL` field enter the url https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Figtree:ital,wght@0,300..900;1,300..900&display=swap.
4. Select `Resource Type` `Stylesheet`.
5. Click `Create`.
6. Hard refresh (`CTRL` + `F5`) your browser or clear app/browser cache to ensure the new resource loads correctly.

## JavaScript Module Installation

This theme includes a companion JavaScript module which turns this theme from a basic Home Assistant theme into a complete Material Design 3 overhaul of Home Assistant. You'll be able to use different colors, schemes, and contrast levels in your theme colors, and will be able to change the entirety of the Home Assistant user interface to look like a modern Material You app. This can all be configured from a settings panel included with this module.

### (Optional) Download The JavaScript Module Resource Locally in Home Assistant

While the module should be cached in browser after first use, you can download it locally to ensure that the module works offline and consistently.

1. Download the module from this repository [here](https://github.com/Nerwyn/material-rounded-theme/blob/dev/dist/material-you-utilities.min.js).
2. Upload this module to your Home Assistant instance, preferable in the `config/www` folder or a subfolder.
   - Your `configuration.yaml` file is found in the `config` folder. If the `www` folder does not exist create it. More information about the configuration folder can be found [here](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/#to-find-the-configuration-directory).

**Remember!** You must update your local copy of this module manually as update are made. Release notes will call out JavaScript module changes. Don't forget to also thoroughly clear cache on all devices!

### Add the Module as a Frontend Module and Custom Panel

The component design upgrades performed by this module are very time sensitive, and must be run as soon as possible. Because of this you should install it as a frontend module in your `configuration.yaml` file.

1. Open your `configuration.yaml` (see above for information about the configuration folder).
2. Add the file URL to `frontend` `extra_module_url`, adding the `frontend` and `extra_module_url` keys if they do not exist, and adding to them if they do.
   - If you have links to any old versions of the theme here or in frontend resources, **delete them**.

```yaml
frontend:
  themes: !include_dir_merge_named themes
  extra_module_url:
    - /local/material-you-utilities.min.js # Or the CDN URL
```

CDN URL: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/nerwyn/material-rounded-theme@main/dist/material-you-utilities.min.js

3. Add the following to `panel_custom`, creating it if it does not exist. This will allow you to access the Material You Theme configuration panel.
   - More information about custom panels can be found [here](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/panel_custom/).

```yaml
panel_custom:
  - name: material-you-panel
    url_path: material-you-configuration
    sidebar_title: Material You Theme
    sidebar_icon: mdi:material-design
    module_url: /local/material-you-utilities.min.js # Or the CDN URL
```

4. Restart Home Assistant.

Once Home Assistant has finished restarting, you should see the upgrade Material Design 3 components and the Material You Theme settings panel in the sidebar. You may need to clear app/browser cache.

## The Configuration Panel

This theme comes with it's own configuration panel! If you are the Home Assistant server administrator, you can use this panel to create and set input helper entities for all users and global defaults. If you are not the administrator you can set the input helper entities for yourself, but an administrator must create them first.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nerwyn/material-rounded-theme/dev/assets/configuration-panel.png" width="750"/>

The settings for every user and the global settings are all the same. If a user does not have a setting set, then the global setting is used.

To create input helper entities for a user, click on `Create Helpers` in their settings card. Similarly, you can delete input helper entities for a user by clicking `Delete Helpers`. After creating helpers, you or their non-admin user can modify them from the configuration panel or open their more info dialog using the buttons to their left.

### Base Color

Material color themes are built around a base color, from which all other theme colors are derived depending on the scheme rules. This color defaults to `#4C5C92` (a shade of blue), but can be set to any other color using the color picker.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nerwyn/material-rounded-theme/dev/assets/base-color-picker.png" width="750"/>

#### Home Assistant Android App Color Sensor

If you are using the Home Assistant Android companion app, you can enable the accent color sensor in the companion app settings to use your phones Material You accent color as the theme base color:

1. Navigate to `Settings` > `Companion app`.
2. Click `Manage sensors.`
3. Scroll down to the section titled `Dynamic color` and click `Accent color`.
4. Toggle `Enable sensor` on. It should now return your phone's Material You base color as a hex code.

You can then create an automation to set your Material You base color whenever the sensor changes.

```yaml
description: ''
mode: single
triggers:
  - trigger: state
    entity_id:
      - sensor.pixel_fold_accent_color
conditions: []
actions:
  - action: input_text.set_value
    metadata: {}
    data:
      value: '{{ states("sensor.pixel_fold_accent_color") }}'
    target:
      entity_id: input_text.material_you_base_color
```

### Alternate Schemes

By default, this theme will use the `Tonal Spot` color scheme. This scheme is the default color scheme used by Android 12 and later.

In addition to the modern Android color scheme, [Material Color Utilities](https://github.com/material-foundation/material-color-utilities) offers several alternate schemes.

If an invalid or no scheme is provided, it will default to `Tonal Spot` or the globally set scheme.

### Contrast Level

Each scheme can also be provided with a custom contrast from -1 to 1. Value outside of this range are clamped to it. If an invalid or no value is provided it will default to `0`.

### Style Upgrades

If you want to disable the Material Design 3 component upgrades, toggle Style Upgrades off. Doing so will still allow you to set custom color themes.

## Material You Components

In addition to the CSS custom properties in the theme YAML, this themes companion module modifies the lifecycle methods styles of many Home Assistant component constructors to inject additional CSS styles to make the components follow the Material Design 3 specification.

### Navigation

#### [Top App Bar](https://m3.material.io/components/top-app-bar/overview)

Menu buttons and view name displayed at the top of the screen.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nerwyn/material-rounded-theme/dev/assets/top-app-bar.png" width="500"/>

#### [Navigation Bar](https://m3.material.io/components/navigation-bar/overview)

View tabs displayed at the bottom of the screen, dynamically scaling with page width.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nerwyn/material-rounded-theme/dev/assets/navigation-bar.png" width="500"/>

##### Notes

- The view tabs are more akin to [Material Design 3 tabs](https://m3.material.io/components/tabs/overview), but I chose to restyle them as a navigation bar as doing so was one of the original purposes of this theme. View tabs as a navigation bar makes more sense within the context of how Home Assistant dashboards are used, and are much easier to use on tall phone displays.
- Displaying navigation bars alongside drawers/rails is not considered good practice, but is done so in this theme due to the increased accessability the bottom aligned navigation bar offers over top aligned tabs.
- Home Assistant itself uses bottom aligned tabs for mobile settings pages, which is similar to the navigation bar.

#### [Navigation Drawer](https://m3.material.io/components/navigation-drawer/overview)

Desktop sidebar expanded and mobile modal navigation menu.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nerwyn/material-rounded-theme/dev/assets/navigation-drawer.png" width="500"/>

##### Notes

- The navigation drawer (and rail below) is smaller in width and destination size than the specification calls for. This is to prevent it from taking up too much horizontal space, and due to difficulty restyling it without modifying the `ha-drawer` element, which is rendered too early to consitently modify the styles of.
- The navigation drawer is supposed to have a top and bottom left border radius, but adding this requires modifying `ha-drawer`, which is rendered too early to be consistently modified.

#### [Navigation Rail](https://m3.material.io/components/navigation-rail/overview)

Desktop sidebar collapsed.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nerwyn/material-rounded-theme/dev/assets/navigation-rail.png" width="200"/>

##### Notes

- The navigation rail style used by Home Assistant / this theme is [no longer considered best practice due to it not having visible labels](https://m3.material.io/components/navigation-rail/guidelines#0e078309-035a-42fa-b951-52ab63e4b0c0), despite it appearing in navigation rail screenshots in other parts of the specification and it still being used by Material You apps. I opted to not implemented navigation bar like labels as the sidebar expands into a drawer with labels, and because it would be difficult to modify the style of the navigation rail destinations to match the with label specification and still gracefully expand into a drawer.

### [Cards](https://m3.material.io/components/cards/overview)

The ubiquitous container which most Home Assistant lovelace elements are built around.

#### [Elevated Card](https://m3.material.io/components/cards/specs#a012d40d-7a5c-4b07-8740-491dec79d58b)

A background color similar to the view background with elevation. The default card style.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nerwyn/material-rounded-theme/dev/assets/elevated-card.png" width="500"/>

#### [Filled Card](https://m3.material.io/components/cards/specs#0f55bf62-edf2-4619-b00d-b9ed462f2c5a)

A contrasting background color with no elevation.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nerwyn/material-rounded-theme/dev/assets/filled-card.png" width="500"/>

#### [Outlined Card](https://m3.material.io/components/cards/specs#9ad208b3-3d37-475c-a0eb-68cf845718f8)

An outlined card with the same background color as the view and no elevation.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nerwyn/material-rounded-theme/dev/assets/outlined-card.png" width="500"/>

#### Notes

- In order to use card styles other than elevated, you have to modify the class of the card using card-mod.

```yaml
card_mod:
  class: 'filled' # or 'outlined'
```

- The specification says to use border-radius shape `--md-sys-shape-corner-medium` (12px), but I opted to instead use `--md-sys-shape-corner-extra-large` (28px). I had a few reasons for this.
  1. Material Design 3 cards are containers for interactable elements and information, but cards in Home Assistant are mostly interactable elements themselves. Interactable elements in Material Design 3 tend to have much rounder corners.
  2. Material Design 3 specification website itself uses larger more rounded border radii for card elements.
  3. Material Design 3 apps like Google Home use larger border radii for card-like interactable elements.

### Buttons

#### [Text Buttons](https://m3.material.io/components/buttons/specs#899b9107-0127-4a01-8f4c-87f19323a1b4)

Buttons that are just text with no background.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nerwyn/material-rounded-theme/dev/assets/text-button.png" width="500"/>

#### [Outlined Buttons](https://m3.material.io/components/buttons/specs#de72d8b1-ba16-4cd7-989e-e2ad3293cf63)

Like text buttons, but with an outline.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nerwyn/material-rounded-theme/dev/assets/outlined-button.png" width="200"/>

#### [Extended FAB](https://m3.material.io/components/extended-fab/overview)

Floating action buttons which appear in legacy views, and the integrations, devices, and helpers pages.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nerwyn/material-rounded-theme/dev/assets/extended-fab.png" width="500"/>

### [Chips](https://m3.material.io/components/chips/overview)

Small button-like elements that can be used to display information or fire actions.

#### [Outlined Chips](https://m3.material.io/components/chips/specs#a144389c-9478-4fe4-9bd8-ca9f7dd830eb)

Follows the Assist Chip specification. Used in configuration menus and HACS.

#### [Filled Chips](https://m3.material.io/components/chips/specs#e900592f-75a4-4298-853c-bedd8f462f83)

Follows the Filter Chip (selected) specification. Can be added to the header or footer of some cards to fire actions and used in add-ons pages.

#### Notes

- Chips in Home Assistant do not function like chips in Material Design 3. Instead of being informational or for less important actions, they are generally equivalent to buttons.
- Badges in Home Assistant are not equivalent to [Material Design 3 badges](https://m3.material.io/components/badges/overview), they are instead like a hybrid between cards and chips. It doesn't make sense to style them as chips as it tends to make them look worse, especially when used with entity pictures.

### Inputs

#### [Switches](https://m3.material.io/components/switch/overview)

Toggle switches for setting boolean values.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nerwyn/material-rounded-theme/dev/assets/switch.png" width="500"/>

##### Notes

- The re-styling of switches causes a horizontal overflow issue if its too close to the trailing end of the page. While I think I've added `overflow-x: hidden` to most pages where this can occur, I may have missed some. Let me know if you find any!

#### [Sliders](https://m3.material.io/components/sliders/overview)

Numerical inputs optimized for human interaction.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nerwyn/material-rounded-theme/dev/assets/slider.png" width="500"/>

##### Notes

- The specification calls for the tooltip to appear and the handle to narrow when the slider is focused or pressed, but not hovered. The Home Assistant slider shows the tooltip on hover, and it is difficutl to disable this behavior without breaking the tooltip and slider narrowing altogether. So instead the tooltip appears and handle narrows on hover.
- Home Assistant actually has its own implementation of a Material Design 3 slider, but it is only used for the card configuration layout grid size picker. The styles of this slider have been slightly modified to use theme colors, to modify the tooltip size, and to narrow the handle when pressed or focused.

### Pop-ups

#### [Snackbars](https://m3.material.io/components/snackbar/overview)

Floating messages that appear on the bottom of the screen, also known as toasts.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nerwyn/material-rounded-theme/dev/assets/snackbar.png" width="500"/>

##### Notes

- The bottom offset of snackbars has been increased to appear above the navigation bar, fixing it from preventing you from navigating your dashboard if a snackbar was in the way. I was not able to figure out a way to make this bottom offset change depending on whether the navigation bar was visible or not, as the navigation bar and snackbar are deep within different shadow roots.

#### [Dialogs](https://m3.material.io/components/dialogs/overview)

Windows that appear to display information or ask for user input, like more-info and confirmation dialogs.

##### [Basic Dialogs](https://m3.material.io/components/dialogs/specs#23e479cf-c5a6-4a8b-87b3-1202d51855ac)

Lighter color and updated font.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nerwyn/material-rounded-theme/dev/assets/basic-dialog.png" width="500"/>

##### [Full-screen Dialogs](https://m3.material.io/components/dialogs/specs#bbf1acde-f8d2-4ae1-9d51-343e96c4ac20)

Background color changes on scroll and updated font.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nerwyn/material-rounded-theme/dev/assets/full-screen-dialog.png" width="500"/>

##### Notes

- Home Assistant has a more modern dialog used for confirmations and similar messages. This dialog mostly follows the Material Design 3 specification, but does not turn into a full-screen dialog on smaller displays.

## (Alternative/Optional) Build Your Own Theme

If you do not want to use the JavaScript module resource, you can instead create your own Material Theme using [Material Theme Builder](https://material-foundation.github.io/material-theme-builder/).

**NOTE**: themes created this way will not apply to iframes such as the HACS and Add-ons pages. It will also not apply to some page backgrounds like the settings and developer tools pages, which are hardcoded to a default color. It will also be superceded by any themes set using the configuration panel.

1. Navigate to [Material Theme Builder](https://material-foundation.github.io/material-theme-builder/).
2. Choose your theme colors. You can skip picking fonts, they are not saved to the exported files.
3. Click `Export theme`, click `Export`, and then click `Web (CSS)`.
4. Extract the CSS files from the downloaded zip archive and open the css folder within it.
5. Choose a matching set of light and dark css files with the same contrast extension (or mix and match) and open them in a text editor.
   - `light.css` and `dark.css` are standard, `-mc` is medium contrast, and `-hc` is high contrast.
6. Find and replace (`CTRL` + `F`) all colons `:` in the CSS files and replace them with `-light:` in the light file and `-dark:` in the dark file.
7. Copy all of the variables from one file to the other, and rename the selector (`.dark`, `.light-high-contrast`, etc) to `html`. It should look something like this:

```css
html {
  --md-sys-color-primary-dark: rgb(242 220 130);
  --md-sys-color-surface-tint-dark: rgb(219 198 110);
  --md-sys-color-on-primary-dark: rgb(45 37 0);
  --md-sys-color-primary-container-dark: rgb(163 144 63);
  ...
  --md-sys-color-surface-container-lowest-light: rgb(255 255 255);
  --md-sys-color-surface-container-low-light: rgb(250 243 229);
  --md-sys-color-surface-container-light: rgb(238 232 218);
  --md-sys-color-surface-container-high-light: rgb(227 220 207);
  --md-sys-color-surface-container-highest-light: rgb(215 209 196);
}
```

8. (Optional) Rename the file to something recognizable, like `material-design-colors.css`

9. Upload this file to your Home Assistant instance, preferable in the config/www folder.
   - Your `configuration.yaml` file is found in the `config` folder. If the `www` folder does not exist create it. More information about the configuration folder can be found [here](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/#to-find-the-configuration-directory).
10. Navigate to a dashboard and then click `ðŸ–‰ Edit dashboard` > `â‹® Open dashboard menu` > `Manage resources`.
11. Click `+ ADD RESOURCE`.
12. In the `URL` field enter the path to the resource file.
    - Like `/local/material-design-colors.css`
13. Select `Resource Type` `Stylesheet`.
14. Click `CREATE`.
15. Hard refresh (`CTRL` + `F5`) your browser or clear app/browser cache to ensure the new resource loads correctly.

### Bubble Card

This theme includes variables to style [Bubble Card](https://github.com/Clooos/Bubble-Card) elements using Material You colors and shapes. Bubble card pop-ups are equivalent to [bottom sheets](https://m3.material.io/components/bottom-sheets/overview) and have their background color and border radius set to better match its specification.

Here is the basic configuration I use to make Bubble Card pop-ups look more like modal bottom sheets.

```yaml
type: vertical-stack
cards:
  - type: custom:bubble-card
    card_type: pop-up
    hash: '#your-hash-here'
    width_desktop: 90vw # This should be 640px per the specification, but I prefer near full width dialogs on desktop
    close_by_clicking_outside: true
    show_header: false
    styles: |-
      #root {
        /* Optional, best for pop-ups with no scroll */
        height: fit-content !important;
      }
      .bubble-pop-up-container {
        /* Only recommended if using ha-card elements instead of Bubble Card elements */
        padding-left: 0 !important;
        padding-right: 0 !important;
        /* Optional, use with height: fit-content above to fix display issues */
        padding-bottom: 64px !important;
      }
  - type: custom:bubble-card
    card_type: separator # A modified separator to mimic the bottom sheet drag handle
    styles: |-
      .bubble-icon, .bubble-name {
        display: none;
      }
      .bubble-line {
        margin-right: 0;
        height: 4px;
        background: var(--md-sys-color-on-surface-variant);
      }
      ha-card {
        width: 32px;
        left: calc(50% - 16px);
      }
```

### Material Symbols

Check out [Material Symbols](https://github.com/beecho01/material-symbols) to use updated material icons as shown in the screenshots!

### Material Design 3 and Material Color Utilities

This theme revolves around Material Design 3 and the tooling that its contributors have made available, especially [Material Color Utilities](https://github.com/material-foundation/material-color-utilities) and the [Material Design 3 specification](https://m3.material.io/).

### Figtree Font

During development of this theme, I experimented with various fonts to find one that was both very similar to Google Sans font and free to use. After much comparison, I found that [Figtree](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Figtree) was very close, and added it to this themes font-family priority list. You can install it as a frontend resource in Home Assistant using [this URL](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Figtree:ital,wght@0,300..900;1,300..900&display=swap).

## Developing, Modifying, and Building The Theme

The JavaScript module is written in TypeScript and requires npm and Node.js to develop. This theme has a build pipeline which runs on pre-commit. To setup the pre-commit hook, run the command `npm run setup`.

### YAML Theme

The `material_you.yaml` file found in the `src` folder is the base version of the theme. It has defaults set for all Material Design System colors in light and dark mode, which are then used for all other theme variables. The pre-commit build pipeline will run a JavaScript file name `pre-commit.js`, which creates six versions of this theme for transparent card backgrounds, and explicit dark and light modes.

### JavaScript Module

The JavaScript module is a minified file compiled using webpack. The source files are all written using TypeScript.

There are four main files:

- `src/classes/material-you-panel.ts` - the configuration panel.
- `src/utils/colors.ts` - the color theming set and unset functions.
- `src/utils/styles.ts` - the component style upgrade application functions.
- `src/material-you-utilities.ts` - the entrypoint file which calls these functions, sets up triggers, and defines the configuration panel custom element.

TypeScript types and interface and constants can be found in `src/models`, along with constants used throughout the module. Other helper functions can be found in `src/utils`.

The styles used by the component style upgrade functions can be found in the `src/css` folder, where they are named after the custom elements they are applied to. They must also be added to the `src/css/index.ts` file elements object to be picked up by the component style upgrade functions.

To build this module, either make a commit (to your own fork) or run the command `npm run build`. The compiled JavaScript module is located at `dist/material-you-utilities.min.js`. Webpack can take a little bit of time to run, especially the first time you run it after opening the terminal.
